When you contribute code to Kactus2 in our environment, Tampere University of Technology becomes the copyright owner of the code by default.

All code should be in the style used for any of the main Kactus2 classes. Please use Doxygen tags before members and functions to mark up any code you submit. Please always follow a Style Guide when it is available at the development environment.
