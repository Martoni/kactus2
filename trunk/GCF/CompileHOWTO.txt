How To Compile
--------------------

To compile GCF you will need to check out a copy of the code and then 
execute the following command in the directory where you can see include 
and source as child directories

On Linux - 
a) qmake -recursive "GCF_BASE=/home/user/GCF"
b) make

On Windows (with Visual Studio 2005) - 
a) qmake -tp vc -recursive "GCF_BASE=C:/GCF"
b) Open VS 2005 and Build All

On Windows (with MinGW)
a) qmake -recursive "GCF_BASE=/home/user/GCF"
b) make

Essentially GCF_BASE should be the complete path of the directory where 
the code is available

System Requirements
--------------------
1. Operating System
    - Windows XP or Windows Vista
    - GNU/Linux (I guess all distros come in this)
2. Compiler

        Qt Assistant + GCF Documentation Integration)
    - Qt Version 4.3 and later (if you want ScriptEditor component)
    - Qt Version 4.2 and later (to use the basic GCF)
