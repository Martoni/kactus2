\brief Provides classes to facilicate commnucation between objects in different GCF applications

\section gcfipc_intro Introduction

GCF version 1.5 and later support communication between objects and components hosted 
within two GCF based applications of the same name. To avail the IPC features in GCF, 
the following conditions have to be met

\li Applications participating in the communication have to be written using GCF
\li Applications participating in the communication must have the same name
\li Applications must have access to a working TCP/IP stack.

\section gcfipc_keyconcepts Key Concepts

There are three key concepts in GCF based IPC

\li Each application has an "Application Access Point" (or AAP) through which exposed objects 
and methods can be accessed by other applications.
\li Each application can create one "Remote Application Access Point" (or RAP) for each remote 
application it needs to communicate with.
\li From a valid "Remote Application Access Point", an application can fetch instances of 
"Remote Objects" based on their object names. Using these "Remote Objects" applications 
can place remote method calls, connect to remote signals/slots and remotely configure object 
properties.
\li Applications can make use of "Remote Application Discovery" service to discover applications, 
running on the same machine or in the local area network, with which it can communicate.

\section gcfipc_keyclasses Key Classes


The classes in GCF implement the concepts mentioned in the previous section

\li GCF::AppAccessPoint: This singleton class can be initialized and accessed via the 
GCF::AppAccessPoint::instance() method to listen on an port for incoming remote application 
access requests. Developers can use this class to specify a server port to listen to and 
also enable/disable access to your application from remote apps.
\li GCF::RemoteAppAccessPoint: This class can be connect to a remote application. Instances 
of this class cannot be created using the new C++ operator, one has to make use of the 
class's static method getRemoteAppAccessPoint(). This method accepts the host address 
and port of the application where its application access point is listening.
\li GCF::RemoteObject: By making use of a valid GCF::RemoteAppAccessPoint object, instances of 
GCF::RemoteObject can be fetched for named objects in the remote application. By name, we 
mean the complete name of the exposed object in the remote application. GCF::RemoteObject 
provides methods to place remote method calls, connect to remote slots/signals and 
configure properties of the remote object.
\li GCF::RemoteAppDiscovery: This class provides an easy to use API to asynchronously detect 
availability of remote applications to which one can connect to.

In the following paragraphs, let's look at a few use cases of the above classes.

\subsection gcfipc_usingGCF::AppAccessPoint Using GCF::AppAccessPoint

\code
// Enable remote application access
GCF::AppAccessPoint::instance().setAppAccessEnabled(true);
\endcode

\subsection gcfipc_usingGCF::RemoteAppAccessPoint Connecting to a remote application using GCF::RemoteAppAccessPoint

\code
// Description of the remote application
QHostAddress addr = QhostAddress("192.168.1.30");
quint16 port = 38900;

// Get hold for a RAP 
GCF::RemoteApplicationAccessPoint* rap = 0;
rap = GCF::RemoteApplicationAccessPoint::getRemoteAppAccessPoint(addr, port);

// Connect to notification signals
QObject::connect( rap, SIGNAL(connectedToApp()),
               receiver, SLOT(rapConnectedToApp()));
QObject::connect( rap, SIGNAL(disconnectedFromApp()),
               receiver, SLOT(rapDisconnectedFromApp()));
QObject::connect( rap, SIGNAL(couldNotConnectToApp()),
               receiver, SLOT(rapCouldNotConnectToApp()));
\endcode

\subsection gcfipc_usingGCF::RemoteObject Communicating with remote objects using GCF::RemoteObject

\code
// Get a remote object. Note the object in the remote application should be a QObject
GCF::RemoteObject* rObj = rap->getRemoteObject("MainWindowComponent.window");

// Connect to notification signals
QObject::connect( rObj, SIGNAL(activated()), receiver, SLOT(rObjActivated()) );
QObject::connect( rObj, SIGNAL(deactivated()), receiver, SLOT(rObjDeactivated()) );
QObject::connect( rObj, SIGNAL(couldNotActivate()), receiver, SLOT(rObjCouldNotActivate()) );

// Calls made to the remote object before it is activated, will be queued. Queued
// calls will be sent immediately after the remote object becomes active

// Remote Method Invocations. The remote method has to be signal, slot or 
// Q_INVOKABLE method
rObj->call("setWindowTitle", "Title string from remote application");

// Connecting a local signal to a remote slot
QPushButton* pushButton = get_push_button_from_somwehre();
rObj->makeConnection( pushButton, SIGNAL(clicked(bool)), SLOT(pushButtonClicked()) );

// Connecting a remote signal to a local slot
rObj->makeConnection( SIGNAL(clicked(bool)), pushButton, SLOT(click()) );

// Set property remotely
rObj->setObjectProperty( "text", "My Button" );

// Get property remotely
QVariant value = rObj->getObjectProperty( "text" );

// Cache all properties of the remote object
rObj->cacheProperties();

// Get property value from the cache
rObj->getCachedObjectProperty( "text" );
\endcode

\subsection gcfipc_usingGCF::RemoteAppDiscovery Using GCF::RemoteAppDiscovery to discover remote applications

\code
// Connect to notification signals
QObject::connect( & GCF::RemoteAppDiscovery::instance(),
               SIGNAL(discoveredRemoteApp(GCF::RemoteAppAccessPoint*)),
               receiver,
               SLOT(newRAP(GCF::RemoteAppAccessPoint*)));

// From now on the newRAP() method of the receiver will be called when ever
// GCF::RemoteAppDiscovery discovers a new remote application. Note that the 
// initial greeting message has already been sent and the GCF::RemoteAppAccessPoint
// will be ready to use by the time newRAP is called.

// Begin discovery
GCF::RemoteAppDiscovery::instance().startDiscovery();
\endcode

\subsection gcfipc_currentRemoreApp Knowing the current remote application

Sometimes it might be important for an application to know whether an object's method is being 
accessed locally or remotely. For example you might want to alter the behavior of the function 
based on this information. In such cases you can make use of the static method 
GCF::RemoteApp::currentRemoteApp(). This method returns pointer to an instance of GCF::RemoteApp, 
that handles all communication between this application and a remote application. 
GCF::RemoteApp's methods, peerInfo(), socket() can be used to get enough information about the 
remote application.

Please note that the currentRemoteApp() method returns a valid pointer only when called from 
within a RMI context. It returns a NULL pointer at all other times.

Example

\code
void MyObjectClass::someMethod()
{
    GCF::RemoteApp* rApp = GCF::RemoteApp::currentRemoteApp();

    if( !rApp )
    {
        // Local context
    }
    else
    {
        // Remote context
        QAbstractSocket* rSocket = rApp->socket();
        if( rSocket->peerAddress().toString().startsWith("192") )
            return; 
    }
}
\endcode

\subsection gcfipc_securityInterfaces Security Interfaces

Allowing remote access to applications brings to the table unique security challenges. 
For example, we might not be interested in allowing remote access originating from a 
certain category of systems, we may not be interested in allowing a subset of an 
object's methods/properties/signals/slots to be accessed remotely.

Towards this, you can implement any one or both of the following interfaces

\li IComponentRemoteAccessControl 
\li IObjectRemoteAccessControl


These interfaces are defined as follows in IRemoteAccessControl.h.

\code
/ This interface can be implemented by IComponent subclasses to control
// access to objects contained in it.
class IComponentRemoteAccessControl
{
public:
    // Control global component access. The master on/off switch
    virtual bool isAllowComponentAccess(GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp) = 0;

    // Control per-object access
    virtual bool isAllowObjectAccess(QObject* object, GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp) = 0;
};
Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE(IComponentRemoteAccessControl, "com.vcreatelogic.IComponentRemoteAccessControl/1.0");

// This interface can be implemented by any exposed QObject to help figure out what
// aspects of the object can be remotely accessed
class IObjectRemoteAccessControl
{
public:
    // Control per-object access
    virtual bool isAllowObjectAccess(GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp) = 0;

    // Control per-object method access
    virtual bool isAllowObjectMethodInvoke(int methodIdx, GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp) = 0;

    // Control per-object property access
    virtual bool isAllowObjectSetProperty(int propIdx, GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp) = 0;
    virtual bool isAllowObjectGetProperty(int propIdx, GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp) = 0;

    // Control per-object signal access
    virtual bool isAllowObjectSignalConnect(int signalIdx, GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp) = 0;
    virtual bool isAllowObjectSignalDelivery(int signalIdx, GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp) = 0;
};
Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE(IObjectRemoteAccessControl, "com.vcreatelogic.IObjectRemoteAccessControl/1.0");

\endcode

IComponentRemoteAccessControl interface can be implemented by subclasses of IComponent to 
decide whether component as a whole or any of its objects can be accessed remotely. 

IObjectRemoteAccessControl can be implemented in exposed objects to decide what methods, 
properties, signals and slots can be accessed remotely.

Example:

\code
class MyComponent : public IComponent, virtual public IComponentRemoteAccessControl
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_INTERFACES(IComponentRemoteAccessControl)

    // ..........

    bool isAllowComponentAccess(GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp) {

        // Only allow applications from my LAN to access this component
        if( remoteApp->socket()->peerAddress().toString().startsWith("192") )
            return true;

        return false;
    }

    bool isAllowObjectAccess(QObject* object, GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp) {

        // Since we have implemented isAllowComponentAccess(), remoteApp can be
        // assumed to be from the LAN
        if( !checkForSomeCondition() )
                    return false;
        
        return true;
    }
 };
    
    
class MyObject : public QObject, virtual public IObjectRemoteAccessControl
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_INTERFACES(IObjectRemoteAccessControl)

    // ..........

    Q_INVOKABLE void localInvocableMethodOnly();

    bool isAllowObjectAccess(GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp)
        { return true; }
    bool isAllowObjectMethodInvoke(int methodIdx, GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp)
    {
        QMetaMethod method = metaObject()->method(methodIdx);
        if( QString(method.signature()).startsWith("localInvocableMethodOnly") )
            return false;

        return true;
    }

    bool isAllowObjectSetProperty(int propIdx, GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp)
        { return true; }
    bool isAllowObjectGetProperty(int propIdx, GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp)
        { return true; }
    bool isAllowObjectSignalConnect(int signalIdx, GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp)
        { return true; }
    bool isAllowObjectSignalDelivery(int signalIdx, GCF::RemoteApp* remoteApp)
        { return true; }

    // ..........
};
\endcode

\subsection gcfipc_lookingintofuture Looking into the future


The IPC mechanisms in GCF are not complete and bug-free at this time.
They are already useful if you need what they can do but especially their
security for use over the network should not be relied on.

Keep your copy of GCF updated from the SVN to be in tune with the developments happening in it.

If you are interested to participate in the development, drop an email to info @ vcreatelogic . com.
