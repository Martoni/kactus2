\page menustrip Using MenuStrip in GCF Applications


Modern UI applications are expected to look eye-pleasing and colorful.
To help application developers create modern UIs, GCF comes with a menu-widget
replacement called GCF::MenuStrip. To use the Menu Strip, all you have to do is call 
AbstractComponent::setMenuStripEnabled(true);
before the GCF::Components::MainWindowComponent is initialized. After you do that,
you can replace <menu> and <toolbar> XML elements with <group> XML elements to merge
your actions into the menu strip. Shown below is the PhotoBrowser application with Menu Strip enabled.

\section Menu Strip is Not the Same as Ribbon, Though...

Despite the fact that the Menu Strip looks tall and glossy-colored, it is not identical
to the Ribbon control that you can find in Microsoft Office 2007. Listed below are some
major differences between Ribbon and Menu Strip.

1.The Ribbon has tabs, the Menu Strip has no tabs.
2.The Ribbon adjusts the contained actions when resized, the Menu Strip does not.
3.The Menu Strip can be scrolled to the left or right, the Ribbon can't.
4.The Menu Strip adjusts its color scheme depending on the application's palette,
  the Ribbon doesn't (as far as we know). Shown below is the Menu Strip used within an application using a red palette.
