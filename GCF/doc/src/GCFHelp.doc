\page gcfhelp GCF Help-Qt Assistant integration
\brief Provides information on hosting GCF help documentation inside the Qt Assistant.

One of the most impressive tools in Qt is "Assistant". Qt Assistant provides developers 
access to all sorts of documentation of Qt classes and modules. Starting with Qt 4.4, 
Trolltech made is possible for custom documentation to be hosted inside Qt Assistant. 
From GCF version 1.6 onwards, you can now include GCF documentation within Qt Assistant 
and browse Qt and GCF documentation together.

Care has been taken to ensure that the look and feel of Qt documentation and GCF documentation 
are same. That way you wont feel that you are looking at two different documentation sets.
