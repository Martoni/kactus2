===============================================================================
              + Improvement or feature added
              - Bug fix or something removed
              * Changed or Information
===============================================================================

18/01/2011 1.2 (Build 1)
----------------------------------------------------

+ Added possibility to select the name of the generated ModelSim file with
  an extension.
+ Added more thorough error printing for invalid/incomplete IP-XACT documents.
+ Added off-page connectors with rubber-band routing mode for often used
  interfaces/ports to achieve more readable designs by auto-hiding the rubber-
  band connections when they are not edited.
+ Added the ability to execute ModelSim generator through the component editor.
+ Added the possibility to select which C source file to open through the
  system design editor when right-clicking an application component.
+ Added the SW component type visualization in the component editor.
+ Kactus2 now remembers the filter settings that were set on a previous run
  of the program.

- Fixed the modelsim generator to use the correct syntax for vmake call.
- Fixed the inability to scroll the port map list when a bus interface is
  selected.
- Fixed the problem of opening the component editor by a double-click when a
  view is not selected.
- Fixed the out-of-sync problem of editing the same component simultaneously
  in the component editor and design editor.
- Fixed the crash when editing endpoints in the SW design editor.
- Fixed the regular expression problem in the MCAPI code assist.
- Fixed various small bugs in the system design editor.

* Made the protection feature more user-friendly by not always asking
  the confirmation whether the user wants to unlock the document.
* Simplified some list input boxes by removing explicit add/remove buttons.
* Reorganized the file information view in the component editor.
* Decreased the VLNV fields area on the docking windows.
* Moved the XML file writing order so that the general description is written
  at the beginning part of the file.
* Double-clicking an SW platform component in the platform stack editor now
  opens up the hierarchy if it exists and the component editor only if it
  does not exists (meaning a flat component).
* Removed the always repeating question of whether the user wants to add
  the generated VHDL-file to IP-XACT meta-data if it already exists there.
* Docking windows are now kept visible based on the user's selection of
  what windows to show/hide.



25/11/2011 1.1 (Build 1)
----------------------------------------------------

+ Added undo/redo support for system designs.
+ Added SW design editor for editing SW that will be mapped directly to HW
  components.
+ Added a connection editor for HW designs.
+ Added VHDL template generation for drafted HW components.
+ Added comment generation to the vHDL generator.
+ Added user modifiable code areas to generated VHDL.
+ Added an option to create a new HW design based on an old one.
+ Added component port default value support to the vHDL generator.
+ Added component port type column to the component editor.
+ Default programs set in the operating system are now used to open
  the files in the component editor.
+ Added entity name setting support for the VHDL generator.
+ Added automatic creation of views for HW components (RTL view for IP and SoC
  level components, "hierarchical" view for Chip, Board and Product level
  designs and a fla t view for same lvel components).
+ Added IP-XACT object path to be visible in the component editor's general
  view.
+ Added more information about ports and model parameters to the generated
  documentation.
+ Added the possibility to select which windows are shown and which are hidden.
+ Added a component interface editor for HW designs. 

- Added missing internal bus definitions for MCAPI and SW to the program's
  own internal library.
- Fixed the VLNV editor crash after a library refresh.
- IP-XACT namespace fields are now correctly writted to the generated XML files.
- All created VLNVs are now checked for existence when creating a new object
  through the New dialog to prevent overwrite errors.
- Fixed content assist visibility problem on Linux.
- Fixed the filtering of API/bus definitions according to SW/HW.
- Fixed the crash when scrolling a locked empty design.
- Fixed the error of changes being applied without saving when editing
  hierarchical interfaces of a design.
- Inout ports are now directly mapped to component instance ports as opposed
  to using signals which did not work as expected.

* General page is now shown by default in the component editor.
* Designs can now be browsed and component details previewed even if
  the document is locked.
* Appropriate editor windows on the right side are now automatically
  shown/hidden when an element is selected or deselected on a design.
* Configuration editor is now hidden for other editors than the HW design
  editor.
* Unnecessary ribbon groups are now hidden automatically based on the open
  editor.
* Changed the report generator to categorize ports under bus interfaces
  instead of one long list.



04/10/2011 1.0 (Build 1)
----------------------------------------------------

* Public release
* System designs and MCAPI editing are not fully featured in this release.
  Upcoming system design features include undo/redo support, enhanced code
  generation & validation and Makefile generation.
